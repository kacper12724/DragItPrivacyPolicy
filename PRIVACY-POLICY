Privacy Policy — Drag It

Application: Drag It

Developer: Kacper Kita

Contact: kacper12724@gmail.com

1. Quick summary

Drag It lets drivers discover and arrange meet-ups with other drivers in real time. The App uses your device GPS and network connection to share your current location with other active users. Your location and profile data are only stored on our server while you are actively using the App and are deleted when you exit the App. There are no advertisements, and the App is free to use.

2. Data we collect

a. Data you provide directly

Profile information: display name, car name, engine, horsepower, and location text.

Profile pictures: optional user photo and optional car photo.

b. Data we collect automatically

Precise location (GPS and/or network-based coordinates) while you use the App. Your device transmits your current location to our server and we propagate that location to other active users so they can see you on the map in real time.

Connection and technical data required to operate the service: network connection, GPS coordinates.

c. What we do NOT collect

We do not collect payments, financial information, or personal identifiers beyond the profile fields described above unless you provide them in the profile.

We do not run advertisements or include third‑party advertising/tracker SDKs in the App.

3. How we use your data

We use the data we collect to:

Provide, maintain, and display real-time location and presence of active users on the map.

Allow you to view other active users, see their profile information and optional pictures, and invite them to meet-ups.

Troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent abuse, and protect the security of the App.

4. Data sharing and disclosure

Other users: When you are active in the App, your chosen profile information (name, car name, engine, horsepower, optional pictures, and your current location) is shared with other active users so they can find and invite you to meet-ups.

Service providers / processors: We may use third-party hosting or infrastructure providers to operate our servers. These providers process data on our behalf. We do not sell your personal information.

Legal requirement: We may disclose data if required by law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.

5. Data retention and deletion

While using the App (active session): Your profile data and real-time location are stored on our server and propagated to other active users as long as your session remains active.

After you exit the App: According to the App’s operation, user-specific data (including location and any images provided during the session) is erased from our server when you exit the App.

Backups and logs: To the extent that ephemeral logs or system backups are created as part of normal server operations, those logs will be retained only as long as technically necessary. We do not use backups to keep personal data beyond the session except as required for security or legal reasons.

6. Your choices and controls

Turn off location: You may stop sharing your location by closing the App or by disabling location permissions for the App in your device settings. If you close the App, your data will be removed from our servers per the retention rules above.

Edit profile: You can change or remove the profile information and pictures you provided while the App is active; updates will be propagated in real time to other active users.

Delete account/data: Because the App does not maintain persistent user accounts beyond active sessions, exiting the App removes your session data. If you want additional help confirming deletion or have questions, contact us at the address above.

7. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data while it is in transit or stored on our systems.

8. Children

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us and we will delete it.

9. International transfers

If our servers or service providers are located in a country different from yours, your information may be transferred to and processed in those countries. By using the App you consent to such transfers in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

10. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes that materially affect how we handle personal information, we will update the effective date above and—where required by law—provide appropriate notice.
